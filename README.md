Volt (WIP) is a programming language aimed to be fast & simple at the same time. It can be used for high & low level programming. Volt is unique in that, where traditional garbage collectors slow down the program, volt GC speeds up the program. The main reason we use a GC in the first place, is to keep the language simple like python, go, php, ... and when it runs faster than rust, that's just an extra benefit. You get the best of both worlds.

**Features**: Super fast non-blocking GC ðŸ™Œ, No undefined behaviour, Great package management, Generics, Fast compile times, Cross compiling, Using c-libraries.
